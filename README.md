# DP3A Tapin Website

A website made for The Women and Child Emporewent Institution in Tapin Regency, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. This was a group project for Applications Development project-based learning class in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, done in the last semester, 2020-2021 1. It is a truly project-based learning, since we had to code while learning by ourselves, which was a good experience, especially impactful in my learning skills.
